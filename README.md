## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases and methods to access the databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a basic functionality that makes BambangShop work: ability to create, read, and delete `Product`s.
This repository already contains a functioning `Product` model, repository, service, and controllers that you can try right away.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement another feature: `Notification`.
This feature will notify creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, to external subscribers that are interested of a certain product type.
The subscribers are another Rocket instances, so the notification will be sent using HTTP POST request to each subscriber's `receive notification` address.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Publisher" folder.
This Postman collection also contains endpoints that you need to implement later on (the `Notification` feature).

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL="http://localhost:8000"
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable              | type   | description                                                |
    |-----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where this publisher instance can be accessed. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Publisher) Reflections

#### Reflection Publisher-1

1. In the Observer pattern diagram explained by the Head First Design Pattern book, Subscriber is defined as an interface. Explain based on your understanding of Observer design patterns, do we still need an interface (or trait in Rust) in this BambangShop case, or a single Model struct is enough?

In a classic Observer pattern, defining a Subscriber as an interface makes sense because it allows multiple concrete implementations to observe the subject differently. However, in this BambangShop case, we only have a single kind of subscriber with a fixed set of fields (e.g., url, name). Since we don’t expect multiple variants of subscribers, a single model struct is enough. If the design ever needs different subscriber behaviors, then moving to a trait-based approach would be more appropriate.

2. id in Program and url in Subscriber is intended to be unique. Explain based on your understanding, is using Vec (list) sufficient or using DashMap (map/dictionary) like we currently use is necessary for this case?

Using a Vec for storing subscribers would work in simpler scenarios, but it would require scanning the entire list to find or remove an entry by url, which can be less efficient. Also, when multiple threads are involved, we need to handle synchronization manually. In contrast, a map-like structure such as DashMap lets us quickly look up subscribers by url and handles thread safety automatically, making it a more practical choice when we need fast access and want to ensure that each url is unique.

3. When programming using Rust, we are enforced by rigorous compiler constraints to make a thread-safe program. In the case of the List of Subscribers (SUBSCRIBERS) static variable, we used the DashMap external library for thread safe HashMap. Explain based on your understanding of design patterns, do we still need DashMap or we can implement Singleton pattern instead?

The Singleton pattern is all about ensuring that only one instance of a certain structure exists in program. However, using a Singleton doesn’t automatically solve issues related to concurrent access or thread safety. DashMap, on the other hand, provides built-in support for safely managing data across threads. So even if we used a Singleton to hold the subscriber list, we still need a thread-safe structure like DashMap to handle the actual read and write operations in a multi-threaded environment.

#### Reflection Publisher-2

1. In the Model-View Controller (MVC) compound pattern, there is no “Service” and “Repository”. Model in MVC covers both data storage and business logic. Explain based on your understanding of design principles, why we need to separate “Service” and “Repository” from a Model?

Because it keeps things organized. The Model only holds data structures. The Service handles the business logic like rules and checks. The Repository deals with database actions like saving or retrieving data. Splitting them up makes the code easier to read, test, and change later on.

2. What happens if we only use the Model? Explain your imagination on how the interactions between each model (Program, Subscriber, Notification) affect the code complexity for each model?

If we only use the Model, each entity like Program, Subscriber, and Notification would have to handle every data, business logic, and even inter model communication. This means the Program model might need to decide when and how to notify subscribers, while the Subscriber model could be involved in managing notifications directly. Such overlapping responsibilities create tightly coupled code, making it hard to modify one part without affecting others. The result is a more complex, error-prone system that’s difficult to maintain and test.

3. Have you explored more about Postman? Tell us how this tool helps you to test your current work. You might want to also list which features in Postman you are interested in or feel like it is helpful to help your Group Project or any of your future software engineering projects.

Postman helps us test our API by letting us make requests (GET, POST, etc.) and see the responses. We can save our endpoints in Collections, switch environments (like local or production), and even write scripts to automate tests. It’s a quick way to confirm our code works before we deploy.
